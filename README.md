## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone and Setup**: `git clone <repo>` then `uv venv` and `source .venv/bin/activate`
2. **Install Dependencies**: `uv sync` to install all required packages
3. **GCP Setup**: Follow the [GCP Setup Guide](docs/GCP_SETUP.md) to configure Google Cloud Platform and OAuth2
4. **Initialize**: `calsinki init` to create your configuration structure
5. **Configure**: Edit the generated config file with your calendar details
6. **Authenticate**: `calsinki auth <account_name>` to set up Google Calendar access
7. **Sync**: `calsinki sync` or `calsinki sync <rule_id>` to start calendar synchronization

## üéÆ Command Reference

### Core Commands
```bash
calsinki init                    # Initialize configuration structure
calsinki auth --setup            # Set up OAuth2 configuration (requires GCP setup first)
calsinki auth                    # Authenticate all accounts
calsinki auth personal           # Authenticate specific account
calsinki config                  # Show current configuration
calsinki config --example        # Show example configuration
```

**Note**: Before running `calsinki auth --setup`, you must complete the [GCP Setup Guide](docs/GCP_SETUP.md) to configure Google Cloud Platform and OAuth2 credentials.

### Synchronization
```bash
calsinki sync                    # Sync all enabled sync rules
calsinki sync --dry-run          # Preview sync without making changes
calsinki sync demo_to_personal   # Sync specific sync rule
calsinki sync --list             # List available sync rules
```

### Event Management
```bash
calsinki purge demo_to_personal  # Remove events from specific sync rule
calsinki purge --all             # Remove all synced events from all rules
calsinki purge --dry-run         # Show what would be purged
```

### Safe Operations
Both `sync` and `purge` commands support `--dry-run` mode for safe previewing:
- **Sync dry-run**: Shows what events would be synced without modifying calendars
- **Purge dry-run**: Shows what events would be deleted without removing them

## üìÅ Configuration & Storage

Calsinki follows the XDG Base Directory Specification for configuration and data storage:

- **Configuration**: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/calsinki/config.yaml` (safe to commit to dotfiles)
  Default locations:
  - Linux: `~/.config/calsinki/config.yaml`
  - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/calsinki/config.yaml`
  - Windows: `%APPDATA%\calsinki\config.yaml`
- **OAuth2 Config**: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/calsinki/credentials/oauth2_config.yaml` (contains Google API credentials - never commit)
- **Credentials**: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/calsinki/credentials/` (never commit - contains OAuth2 tokens)
  Default locations:
  - Linux: `~/.local/share/calsinki/credentials/`
  - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/calsinki/credentials/`
  - Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\calsinki\credentials\`
- **Data**: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/calsinki/data/` (sync metadata and logs)

If you have custom XDG paths set (e.g., `XDG_CONFIG_HOME=~/.config`), Calsinki will respect them automatically. Otherwise, it uses your operating system's default application directories.

### üîí Security & Privacy
- **Configuration files** (`config.yaml`) are safe to commit to dotfiles
- **OAuth2 credentials** and **API keys** are stored in `$XDG_DATA_HOME` (never commit)
- **Sync metadata** is stored in destination events (Google Calendar handles privacy)
- **No sensitive data** is logged or transmitted beyond Google's secure APIs

## üèóÔ∏è Configuration Structure

Calsinki uses a modern, nested configuration structure that makes calendar management intuitive and maintainable:

### Account-Based Organization
- **Accounts**: Each Google account (work, personal, etc.) is defined separately
- **Nested Calendars**: Calendars belong to their respective accounts
- **Unique Labels**: Each calendar has a human-readable label within its account

### Label-Based References
Instead of using long calendar IDs, Calsinki uses a simple `account.label` format:
- `work.primary` - The primary calendar in your work account
- `personal.family` - A family calendar in your personal account
- `xteam.team` - A team calendar in your xteam account

This makes your configuration much more readable and maintainable!

### Example Structure
```yaml
accounts:
  - name: "work"
    calendars:
      - label: "primary"          # Referenced as "work.primary"
      - label: "team"             # Referenced as "work.team"
  
  - name: "personal"
    calendars:
      - label: "primary"          # Referenced as "personal.primary"
      - label: "family"           # Referenced as "personal.family"
```

## üé® Event Customization

Calsinki allows you to customize how synced events appear in your destination calendars:

### Title Customization
- **Prefix**: Add text before event titles (e.g., `[WORK]`, `TEAM:`)
- **Suffix**: Add text after event titles (e.g., `(synced)`, `[external]`)

### Event Colors
You can assign specific colors to synced events using Google Calendar's color IDs:

| Color ID | Color Name | Description |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| `"1"` | Lavender | Soft purple |
| `"2"` | Sage | Muted green |
| `"3"` | Grape | Rich purple |
| `"4"` | Flamingo | Bright pink |
| `"5"` | Banana | Light yellow |
| `"6"` | Tangerine | Bright orange |
| `"7"` | Peacock | Teal blue |
| `"8"` | Graphite | Dark gray |
| `"9"` | Blueberry | Deep blue |
| `"10"` | Basil | Forest green |
| `"11"` | Tomato | Bright red |

**Note**: Leave `event_color` empty (`""`) or omit the field to use the destination calendar's default color.

### Sync Metadata
Calsinki automatically adds comprehensive metadata to all synced events:

- **`last_synced`**: ISO timestamp of when the event was last synchronized
- **`last_sync_human`**: Human-readable timestamp (e.g., "2025-01-27 14:30:45 UTC")
- **`sync_count`**: Number of times the event has been synchronized
- **`source_calendar_id`**: ID of the source calendar
- **`source_event_id`**: Original event ID from the source calendar
- **`sync_version`**: Version of the sync metadata format

This metadata is stored in the event's extended properties and can be viewed in Google Calendar's event details.

### Bi-Directional Sync Protection
Calsinki automatically prevents infinite sync loops when using bi-directional sync rules. If you set up sync rules in both directions (e.g., `personal_to_work` and `work_to_personal`), Calsinki will:

- **Detect Calsinki-synced events** in source calendars
- **Skip syncing** events that already have Calsinki metadata
- **Prevent loops** from creating endless event duplication
- **Log skips** for debugging and monitoring

This ensures safe bi-directional synchronization without manual intervention.

### Example Configuration
```yaml
# Google Calendar accounts with nested calendars
accounts:
  - name: "work"
    email: "work@company.com"
    auth_type: "oauth2"
    calendars:
      - label: "primary"
        calendar_id: "work@company.com"
        name: "Work Calendar"
        description: "Primary work calendar"

  - name: "personal"
    email: "personal@gmail.com"
    auth_type: "oauth2"
    calendars:
      - label: "primary"
        calendar_id: "personal@gmail.com"
        name: "Personal Calendar"
        description: "Primary personal calendar"

# Sync rules using calendar labels
sync_rules:
  - id: "work_to_personal"
    source_calendar: "work.primary"
    destination:
      - calendar: "personal.primary"
        privacy_mode: "private"
        title_prefix: "[WORK]"
        title_suffix: "(synced)"
        event_color: "3"  # Grape color
        enabled: true
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Calsinki is built as a Python command-line tool that:
1. Reads configuration from a nested YAML structure with accounts and calendars
2. Authenticates with Google Calendar APIs using OAuth2 device flow
3. Syncs events from source calendars to multiple destination calendars using sync rules
4. Maintains sync metadata for reliable updates and duplicate prevention
5. Automatically handles event lifecycle (creation, updates, deletion)
6. Provides safe preview modes for all operations
7. Runs automatically on your schedule
8. Uses label-based references for human-readable calendar identification
